<h2 id="conceptual-overview">Conceptual Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>History of Science has been often misrepresented</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Indian Historians: India portrayed as a place where all the worthwhile things developed</li>
<li>Some Postcolonial Historians: Modern Science portrayed as only a Western knowledge system, which colonizes and silences other ways of thinking around the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to look at science in their historical and cultural contexts</p>
<ul>
<li>The people of the past were not aiming at creating Science as we know it today</li>
<li>They tried to answer the questions relevant to them using the methods and tools that seemed plausible to them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>History of Science is also a history of inter-civilizational transplantations. Ideas from different cultures and civilizations have also influenced each other</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-science">What is Science?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Science is <em>objective knowledge</em>
<ul>
<li>based on facts rather than opinions</li>
<li>empirical testability</li>
<li>reproducibility of experiments minimizes personal bias</li>
<li>mathematization of nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Facts</strong> : Facts are claims about nature that can be established and verified by careful, unprejudiced use of the senses</p>
<h2 id="science-before-modern-science">Science Before Modern Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shared aim to comprehend the material world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science was not separated from Religion, Theology, Philosophy</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy was the <em>Queen</em> of Science</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No empirical testing, but logical and sometimes mathematical proofs, and more of philosophy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Natural Philosophers didn't <em>dirty their hands</em> for experimentation. Knowledge and proofs were textual (except to some extent in medicine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some commonly observable and irrefutable facts taken and General Frameworks built on them</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of these &quot;facts&quot;:
<ul>
<li>Earth is heavier than air</li>
<li>Fire leaps upwards</li>
<li>Earth we stand upon is stationary ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="accomplishment-of-modern-science">Accomplishment of Modern Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Development of <strong>language</strong> for describing the world of nature</li>
<li>Development of mathematical thought</li>
<li>Observational records of planets, stars, ..., &quot;The Heavens&quot;</li>
<li>Philosophical Frameworks developed and opened up new ways of thinking</li>

<p>DNA Evidence has been conclusive that modern humans are all descendants of a single population of <strong>Out of Africa</strong> migrants who moved into Asia sometime after 70,000 years ago and then spread around the world.</p>
<p>They then replaced their genetic cousins such as <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> and other species of the genus Homo</p>

<ul>
<li>Civilizations emerge only after neolithic or agricultural societies merge into urban areas or cities</li>
<li>Civilizations are the product of urban revolutions</li>
<li><strong>Urbanization</strong> means the emergence of cities</li>
<li><strong>Civilization</strong> refers to a specific cultural stage generally associated with cities and writing
<ul>
<li>There have been some cases where neolithic settlements have been described as urban even in the absence of writing
<ul>
<li>8th Millenium BCE - Jericho in the Jordan Valley</li>
<li>7th Millenium BCE - Çatal Hüyük in Turkey</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>V Gordon Childe described some abstract criteria for defining cities and differentiating them from older and contemporary villages</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="childes-10-characteristics-of-cities">Childe's 10 Characteristics of Cities</h3>
<ol>
<li>The world’s first cities were <strong>larger and more densely populated</strong> than villages.</li>
<li>While the city population may have included some farmers and herdsmen, it also <strong>comprised full-time craftspersons, merchants, transporters, officials, and priests</strong>. These groups were <strong>supported by the surplus food produced by farmers</strong>.</li>
<li>Farmers had to hand over their surplus produce as tax or tribute to a <strong>ruling elite</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Monumental public buildings</strong> were hall marks of cities and reflected the concentration of social surplus (i.e., surplus produce and wealth generated in a society) in the hands of the elite.</li>
<li>There was a trade-off between the ruling class and the rest of society. <strong>Rulers lived off the surplus produced by farmers and in return provided them with peace, security, planning, and organization</strong>.</li>
<li>The invention of <strong>systems of recording</strong>—writing and numeral notation— helped meet the needs of administration.</li>
<li>The invention of writing led to the development of exact but practically useful sciences such as <strong>arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, and the creation of a calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>Conceptualized and sophisticated styles of <strong>artistic expression</strong> made their appearance.</li>
<li>Cities implied a significant amount of <strong>long-distance trade</strong>.</li>
<li>They also implied a <strong>state organization based on residence in a territory rather than on kinship</strong>. The state provided security and materials to specialist craftspersons, enabling them to live a settled rather than an itinerant life.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Such urban revolutions happened in only four places in the ancient world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mesopotamia
<ul>
<li>Tigris and Euphrates</li>
<li>4000 BCE to 330 BCE when conquered by Alexander the Great</li>
<li>Spanned Iraq, Kuwait, northern Saudi Arabia, south-eastern Turkey, eastern Syria and parts of Iran</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Egypt - Nile</li>
<li>India
<ul>
<li>Indus Valley and Harappan Civilizations</li>
<li>2600 BCE to 1500 BCE</li>
<li>Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati?) [gone dry now]</li>
<li>At its peak, it spanned much of Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and western India, including states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China - Yellow and Yangtze</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them were river valleys and flood plains, without which intensive agriculture was not possible</p>
<h3 id="why-river-valleys">Why River Valleys?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rivers bring silt and make the land fertile. As food becomes plentiful, population density grows</li>
<li>They also cause flooding</li>
<li>It becomes necessary to manage water through irrigation canals and employ preventive measures against floods</li>
<li>Centralized states emerge to take care of water management
<ul>
<li>Marshes have to be drained</li>
<li>Dams, dikes, canals have to be built</li>
<li>Water disputes to be settled</li>
<li>Grain surpluses to be collected and stored</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruling classes, armies, temples and bureaucracies emerge</li>
<li>Ruling classes force labour and taxes to sustain the large infrastructure and the monumental architecture (built for prestige)</li>
</ul>
<p>__</p>
<ul>
<li>First signs on agriculture in <strong>Mehrgarh</strong>, in the northwest of Pakistan, Dated to 7000 BCE</li>
<li>Between 56-86% of today's South Asians show the presence of Zagrossian DNA Sequences (Zagros, Iran)</li>
<li>It has been hypothesized that Mehrgarh was the nucleus of Harappan Civilization</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="topic-3-evolution-of-writing">Topic 3: Evolution of Writing</h1>
<h3 id="terms-1">Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epigraphy</strong> - The study of inscriptions</li>
<li><strong>Inscription</strong> - Any writing that is engraved on something - stone, wood, metal, ivory plaques, bronze statues, bricks, clay, shells, pottery, etc</li>
<li><strong>Palaeography</strong> - The study of ancient writing</li>
<li>Three types of Scripts:
<ul>
<li><strong>Logographic Script</strong> - Written symbols stand for a word</li>
<li><strong>Syllabic Script</strong> - Written symbols stand for a syllable</li>
<li><strong>Alphabetic Script</strong> - Written symbols stand for a single phonetic sound</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Writing is reduction of speech (spoken sounds/words) to graphic forms</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth of writing, mathematics and science is deeply connected to the development of urban civilizations with complex division of labour
<ul>
<li>A class of workers (priests, clerks, teachers, etc) emerges whose job is to deal with symbols</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-write">Why Write</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing breaks the flow of the spoken language and sets ideas down in words. This makes it possible to see the logical structure of the argument.</li>
<li>Writing makes it easier to see contradictions because ideas can be formalized and compared side by side. It becomes possible to stand back and examine piece of text in a more abstract and rational manner.</li>
<li>Writing frees the mind from the need to memorize a vast amount of facts and figures.</li>
<li>Writing allows for a greater abstraction and de-contextualization.</li>
<li>It allows for a much easier preservation of ideas and methods, and simplifies workflow in daily interactions between people in a civilization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writings-in-the-mesopotamian-civilization">Writings in the Mesopotamian Civilization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writing emerged in the form of <strong>cuneiforms</strong>, by Sumerians</li>
<li>These are <strong>clay tablets</strong></li>
<li>They used <strong>reed stylus</strong> to make markings on wet clay
<ul>
<li>pointed stylus for objects</li>
<li>rounded stylus for numbers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These clay tablets were then dried in the sun, and could be recycled later when no longer needed</li>
</ul>
<p>__</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cuneiform script underwent gradual evolution from just pictographic record keeping to a real language in which Gods could be praised and mathematical problems could be solved</li>
<li>Evidence:
<ul>
<li>Remains of a school house, <em>House F</em>, which was most probably a school for scribes where students learnt to write in cuneiform
<ul>
<li>Exercises which are just copies</li>
<li>Stories about gods, heroes and even funny stories about students</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Library of Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria (668 BCE to 630 BCE), on the banks of Tigris River in modern day Mosul, Iraq
<ul>
<li>More than 30,000 cuneiform tablets and fragments discovered from this site</li>
<li>Historical inscriptions, letters, administrative and legal texts, and magical, divinatory, literary, medical, lexical texts</li>
<li><strong>Flood Tablet</strong> discovered from here
<ul>
<li>It is a fragment from the <strong>Epic of Gilgamesh</strong> - the first epic poem in the world of literature</li>
<li>Deciphered in 1872 by George Smith</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Temple to Sky God Anu
<ul>
<li>Scholarly tablets from the chief priest, the city of Uruk in 190 BCE</li>
<li>Mathematical Astronomy containing instructions for calculation of dates and positions for key events for Mars, Jupiter, Moon and tabulation of data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writings-in-egypt">Writings in Egypt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scrolls made from <strong>Papyrus</strong></li>
<li>Sheets were made and written on using a reed pen and permanent ink made out of minerals</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writings-in-the-indus-valley">Writings in the Indus Valley</h2>
<ul>
<li>Indus Scripts have been found in as far as Central Asia</li>
<li>Yet Undeciphered Script</li>
<li>The <strong>Cow/Unicorn Seal</strong> discovered in Harappa, made of soap, stone and the size of a postage stamp</li>
<li>Scholars believe the Script might not be a complete language, but rather symbols to identify a product or to indicate a place of origin of a person or a product. These tablets were more like tags or identity cards</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="deciphering-scripts">Deciphering Scripts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Scripts are deciphered through findings of multi-lingual inscriptions in which the same text is written in more than one script</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cuneiform">Cuneiform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deciphered through <strong>Behistun Inscription</strong> - a multi-lingual inscription on a cliff at Mount Behistun, Iran
<ul>
<li>Inscription in three different cuneiform scripts:
<ul>
<li>Old Persian</li>
<li>Elamite</li>
<li>Babylonian (a variety of Akkadian)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="egyptian-heiroglyphs">Egyptian Heiroglyphs</h3>

<li>Deciphered when Napoleon's soldiers discovered the <strong>Rosetta Stone</strong> in Egypt in 1799</li>
<li>Text, written in three languages, of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BCE during the Ptolemaic Dynasty
<ul>
<li>Top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using Hieroglyphic (symbolic) and Demotic (highly cursive) Scripts</li>
<li>Bottom text is in Ancient Greek</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="beginnings-of-writing-in-india">Beginnings of Writing in India</h2>
<ul>
<li>Indus / Harappan Script remains undeciphered</li>
<li>First known and deciphered script is the <strong>Brahmi</strong> Script, during the reign of the Mauryan King Ashoka
<ul>
<li>Sanskrit is much older than Brahmi, but there do not exist any written records, because it was considered a sacred language, the language of the Gods, which are not meant to be written. Sanskrit texts were passed orally by memory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>__</p>
<ul>
<li>The oldest deciphered inscriptions belong to the late 4th century BCE, and are in <strong>Brahmi</strong> and <strong>Kharoshthi</strong> (or Kharoshti)
<ul>
<li>Ashoka's inscriptions mostly in <strong>Prakrit</strong> language and Brahmi Script</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No obvious links between the Harappan Script and Brahmi or Kharoshthi, no knowledge about what happened to writing in between
<ul>
<li>No direct mention of writing in Vedic Literature, but references to poetic metres, grammatical and phonetic terms, very large numbers and complex arithmetical calculations in later Vedic texts indicate the possibility that writing may have been known at the time</li>
<li>First definite literary references to writing occur in the Buddhist Pali texts, especially the Jatakas and the Vinaya Pitaka</li>
<li>Panini's Ashtadhyayi refers to the word &quot;lipi&quot; (script)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both the Brahmi and Kharoshthi scripts are semi-syllabic or semi-alphabetic scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>__</p>
<h4 id="kharoshthi">Kharoshthi</h4>
<ul>
<li>Core area lay in the north-west - in and around the Indus, Swat and Kabul River Valleys, the land known as <strong>Gandhara</strong> in ancient times</li>
<li>Right to Left</li>
<li>Seems to be derived from the North Semitic Aramaic Script</li>
<li>Declined and died out around 3rd century CE</li>
<li>Deciphered fairly easily due to the availablity of bi-script coins in Greek and Kharoshthi issued by the Indo-Greek Coins</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="brahmi">Brahmi</h4>
<ul>
<li>Left to Right</li>
<li>Origins are not clear. Some scholars suggest indigenous origin, some suggest an Aramaic origin [however, the direction of writing is different, so it is more likely that the origin is indigenous]</li>
<li>Kharoshthi died out, while Brahmi became the parent of all the indigenous scripts of South Asia and also for some in Central and South-East Asia</li>
<li>Different stages of the Brahmi Script are often labelled on the basis of the dynasties
<ul>
<li><strong>Ashokan Brahmi</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deciphered by a lot of efforts by a number of administrator-scholars working as employees of the East India Company, most notably <strong>James Prinsep</strong> (also played a role in deciphering Kharoshthi)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kushana Brahmi</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gupta Brahmi</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the late 6th century, the Gupta Brahmi evolved into a script known as <strong>Siddhamatrika</strong> or <strong>Kutila</strong>, which had sharp angles at the lower right corner of each letter</li>
<li>Modern North Indian Scripts gradually emerged out of Siddhamatrika</li>
<li><strong>Nagari</strong> or <strong>Devanagari</strong> was standardized by about 1000 CE and an eastern script (known as <strong>Proto-Bengali</strong> or <strong>Gaudi</strong>) took shape between the 10th and 14th centuries</li>
<li>From these, the Bengali, Assamese, Oriya and Marathi scripts originated in the 14th-15th centuries. Sharada Script emerged in Kashmir and adjoining areas</li>
</ul>
<p>__</p>
<ul>
<li>The first pure Sanskrit inscriptions appeared in the 1st century BCE</li>
<li>The first long Sanskrit inscription is the Junagadh rock inscription of the western king Rudradaman</li>
<li>By the end of 3rd century CE, Sanskrit had gradually replaced Prakrit as the language of inscriptions in northern India</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tamil-brahmi-and-southern-scripts">Tamil-Brahmi and Southern Scripts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Earliest inscriptions in Tamil (with some Prakrit elements) are engraved in rock shelters and caves, mostly in the area near Madurai, in the form of script known as <strong>Tamil Brahmi</strong></li>
<li>Three southern scripts emerged in the early medieval period
<ul>
<li>Grantha</li>
<li>Tamil</li>
<li>Vatteluttu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grantha was used for writing Sanskrit, the other two for writing Tamil</li>
<li>These scripts may have emerged from southern varities of Brahmi, or from some other earlier southern scripts</li>
<li>The Tamil Script first appeared in the Pallava territory in 7th century CE</li>
<li>Telugu and Kannada scipts took shape in 14th-15th centuries</li>
<li>Malayalam script developed out of Grantha at about the same time</li>
